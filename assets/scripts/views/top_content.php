                            Your child doesnâ€™t want to read and you are getting worried for him?
                            Thanks to FunRead, we are changing the whole reading process. FunRead is a combination of a learning experience and an opportunity to play their favorite games. Entering this motivating circle, children will read to accumulate the points they need to play their games.
                            We ensure a responsible reading by asking them the right questions at the end of every chapter so they can access the game.
                            Reading is necessary, FunRead is the best tool to make your child read more. Come & join us.
