                                Your child doesnâ€™t want to read and you are getting worried for him?
                                Thanks to FunRead, we are changing the whole reading process. FunRead is a combination of a learning experience and an opportunity to play their favorite games. Entering this motivating circle, children will read to accumulate the points they need to play their games.
